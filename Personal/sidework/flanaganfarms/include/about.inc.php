	<p>
		Flanagan Farms specializes in all-natural, pasture-raised beef for the most discerning 
		palates. Hand-selected and pasture-raised in the lush rolling hills surrounding Strokestown, 
		County Roscommon, our Aberdeen Black Angus beef cattle produce tender, healthy cuts of meat 
		that are infused with exceptional flavour.
	</p>
	<p>
		Producing grass-fed, rotationally grazed cattle requires considerably more work and time. We 
		firmly believe, however, that the results and our customers are well worth the extra effort.
	</p>

	<h4>Irish Grown. Pasture Raised. Grass Fed.</h4>
	<p>
		For over 300 years the Flanagans have reared cattle on the fertile land surrounding the Sliabh 
		Bán in County Roscommon.  Since the days of Queen Maeve, the lands surrounding the Sliabh Bán 
		have been known to produce the finest cattle in Ireland.  Combining generations of both farming 
		and butchering experience, Thomas Flanagan and local butcher and farmer Noel Dockery began 
		raising Aberdeen Angus cattle to provide the neighboring community and restaurants with a local 
		product of the highest quality.
	</p>
	<p>
		The primary focus of Flanagan Farms continues to be defined by best farm practices, the humane 
		treatment of our animals and a high level of environmental consciousness.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our carefully bred cattle graze freely on verdant grass pastures with access to fresh, clean 
		water. They are never given supplemental growth hormones or steroids. We believe we produce the 
		best tasting cuts of beef and burgers in Ireland today.  Simply put, we produce beef for optimum 
		taste, while our competitors produce beef for optimum size and return on investment.
	</p>

	<h4>Our Farming Family</h4>
	<p>
		As hands-on owners, Thomas Flanagan and Noel Dockery are dedicated to quality and excellence in every 
		aspect of Flanagan Farms. Together, they have spent countless hours building their herd and perfecting 
		the products so they can offer it selectively to local restaurants, butcher shops and markets.
	</p>
	<p>
		Flanagan Farms’ Aberdeen Angus herd is raised the old-fashioned way – in a gentle, country 
		environment.  Lush grasses, clovers, natural minerals and salts enrich the pastures where our animals 
		graze rotationally and they always have access to fresh, clean water. Our animals have never been fed 
		animal by-products, nor have they been given hormones, steroids or GMO’s.
	</p>
	<p>
		After taking such painstaking care in raising our livestock, Flanagan Farms believes in continuing 
		that attention to quality through the processing of our meat. We have spared no expense to ensure 
		that our beef is processed in a humane, stress-free and sanitary environment. All of our meat is 
		inspected to the highest standards and carefully packaged for maximum flavour.
	</p>

	<h4>Our Beef</h4>
	<p>
		We have hand-selected and acquired some of the finest Registered Aberdeen Angus cattle in the 
		country.  Each animal was 100% source verified and we have maintained a closed herd, only purchasing 
		stock and beef occasionally from trusted partners who raise their beef in an identical manner.
	</p>
	<p>
		Flanagan Farms’ pasture-raised beef is naturally high in Vitamin E, Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) 
		and Omega-3. CLA has been found to help fight cancer and lower cholesterol, while Omega-3 provides 
		other important health benefits, best of all, it tastes great.
	</p>
	<p>
		To obtain our beef’s signature flavour, Flanagan Farms supplements our herd’s grass diet over the 
		winter months with a blend of locally grown ‘GM free’ wheat and barley. This ensures that the lean, 
		healthy qualities of the premium cuts are complimented by superior marbling and tenderness. To 
		achieve an unmatched buttery flavour and soft texture, our all-natural Aberdeen Angus beef – including 
		our ground beef – is dry-aged for twenty eight days.  Our proprietary mix of ground beef uses prime 
		cuts, not the left over bits and pieces that make up most burgers, to produce the finest tasting 
		burgers in Ireland.
