	<h1>Why grass fed?</h1>

	<p>
		Cattle were meant to eat grass and people were meant to eat cattle.  As omnivores, about the only 
		thing humans cannot eat is grass.  To capture the nutritional value of grass, which has harvested 
		the sun's energy, humans have to eat animals that capture that nutritional value.
	</p>
	<p>
		Grass-fed meat has been shown to have a 60% + increase in omega-3 content, as well as a more 
		favourable omega-6 to omega-3 ratio.  Both fatty acids are essential and must be obtained from 
		food.  It is important to maintain a balance of omega-3 and omega-6 in our diets, as these two 
		substances work together to promote health.

		ProVitamin A / beta-carotene:  Beta-carotene is a fat-soluble vitamin &  antioxidant that is a 
		safe dietary source of vitamin A.  Vitamin A is important to normal vision, bone growth, reproduction, 
		cell division and cell differentiation.  Grass-fed beef has a 10-fold increase in beta-carotene 
		levels.  Taking vitamin A supplements can be dangerously toxic - but, we can eat all the beta-carotene 
		possible and the human body will only convert the amount needed to vitamin A.
	</p>
	<p>
		Vitamin E / alpha-tocopherol:  Vitamin E is also a fat-soluble vitamin / antioxidant that protects 
		cells from the effects of free radicals (which have been reported to contribute to cancer and 
		cardiovascular disease development).  Grass-fed beef increases alpha-tocopherol levels three-fold 
		vs. grain-fed beef.
	</p>
	<p>
		Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA):  Numerous health benefits have been attributed to CLA including 
		reduced carcinogenesis, atherosclerosis, onset of diabetes and body mass.  Grass-fed cattle have 
		been shown to produce 2 to 3 times more CLA than grain-fed cattle.
	</p>
	<p>
		IT'S NATURAL!  Nature had it right all along.  The sun's energy grows the grass that is harvested 
		by the cattle that are harvested by us.  Grass-fed is how it was meant to be; it's how our human 
		construct was prepared to capture the nutritional value of meat.
