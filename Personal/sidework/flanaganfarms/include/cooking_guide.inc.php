	<p>
		Flanagan Farms uses the highest quality beef and our flash freezing process locks in the taste and 
		texture. Just take what you need from your box of Flanagan Farms and cook them up.
	</p>
	<p>
		Remember that Flanagan Farms’ burgers can go straight from the freezer to the Grill or Skillet.
