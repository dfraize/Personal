	<h1>Student creed</h1>
	<p>I will develop myself in a positive manner and avoid anything which would reduce my mental growth or physical health.</p>
	<p>I will develop self-discipline in order to bring out the best in myself and others.</p>
	<p>I will use what I learn in class constructively and defensively; to help myself and others; and never to be abusive or offensive.</p>
	<p>We are a black belt school, we are dedicated, we are motivated, we are  on a quest to be our best.</p>
