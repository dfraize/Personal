				"Doug is a talented and motivated UI Designer and Developer. He is always looking to learn new things and learns them quickly. He is a 
				great person to work with as well. Doug is always open to new ideas, sharing information and having great conversations around these 
				topics. I really enjoyed my time working with Doug."
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="ui-box-rnd-shadow quotes-ctn">
			<p>
				"Doug plays an integral role in the success of our product dev team. His idea to create a "plug and play"" component library that could 
				be easily utilized across our product offerings allowed us to significantly increase our development velocity and release schedule. The 
				way Doug identified the issue, thoroughly reached and thought through a solution, sold the concept to the dev and exec teams, developed 
				it and continues to manage it is a testament to the visionary and high quality approach he consistently delivers. A high point for me is 
				that Doug is able to communicate very technical concepts, solutions or issues to non-technical colleagues in a way that is straightforward 
				and easy to understand. In short, he is one of the finest developers I have worked with over the past 10 years. He delivers a positive 
				impact to any project he is involved with."</p>

		<div class="ui-box-rnd-shadow quotes-ctn">
			<p>
				"The quality of Doug's work doesn't come from luck. He works hard, he works smart, he pays attention, he's a team player, and he learns from 
				both his successes and mistakes. If I had to put together some sort of web super-team I'd want him on it because I know that he'd give 110% 
				and what I'd get would be high quality."
